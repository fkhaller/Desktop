# Matrix-Explorer
a game i have been wroking on
Fairly straight forward. I used a basic linked list structure and created a 3 dimenional list to store each block of data
in the world. Matrix3D initializes the space and linked lists that hold all the blocks of the world. The Iterator does what 
iterators do and helps build object in the world. Object inserter handles putting objects into the world where Object veiwer
lets you see the world in the console. Console commands are handled by the main class where the world is also created.
